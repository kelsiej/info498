                    <h1>Symbols and Images</h1>


                    <p><br><br>

                        <h4>Symbols of Tibetan Buddhism</h4>
                        In Tibetan Buddhism, there are eight different symbols used. These symbols are believed by
                        Tibetan Buddhists to represent gifts that were received by the Buddha when he achieved
                        enlightenment. Included in the eight symbols are a parasol, the golden fish, a treasure vase, a
                        lotus, a right-turning Conch shell, an endless knot, a victory banner, and a wheel.<br><br>
                        <h5>Images of Tibetan Buddhism on the Dalai Lama’s Twitter</h5>
                        While there are many images of the Dalai Lama on his Twitter, none of them appear to contain the
                        common symbols of Tibetan Buddhism. In a few of the images I saw a parasol, but it is likely to
                        be functioning less as a symbol and more as a way to keep in the shade. In most of the images,
                        the Dalai Lama was seen interacting with others in a happy and friendly manner, and in his
                        profile picture, he is smiling. He also posted quite a few videos where he gives advice to
                        people that align with Tibetan Buddhist beliefs, such as the importance of compassion, how we
                        can help others, and lead healthy lives.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Symbols of Catholicism</h4>
                        There are many symbols in catholicism, with the ten main ones being the crucifix, the alpha and
                        omega symbols, the cross, the sacred heart, the IHS and Chi-Rho, the fish, the lamb, the Fleur
                        de Lis, the crossed keys and the dove.<br><br>
                        <h5>Images of Catholicism on the Pope’s Twitter</h5>
                        Most of the media that Pope Francis posts are videos discussing various different topics such as
                        human trafficking, child abuse, mutual understanding between people and religions. In these
                        videos, there is not any Catholic symbolism besides the cross that he wears. Besides his videos,
                        the few images and symbols I noticed that were prominent in the images posted on his twitter
                        account are images of the cross and an emblem barring the crossed keys. Photos were mostly of
                        himself, and other prominent recent figures in Catholicism including Mother Theresa and previous
                        popes. The Virgin Mary, Jesus’s mother, also shows up in photographs of religious images. His
                        profile picture shows a friendly image of himself smiling, and his cover image is him addressing
                        a crowd of people, with most everyone smiling. Profile pictures and cover images are the first
                        things that a visitor sees when they visit a Twitter account and pope Francis is trying to set a
                        positive and happy image of himself as the first impression of his account.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>
                        Both the Pope and the Dalai Lama did not post many photos of religious symbols and instead
                        focused on showing positive images of themselves and others. In comparison to the pope, the
                        Dalai Lama posted far more images - the pope has only posted 30 videos and photos, whereas the
                        Dalai Lama has posted 145.
