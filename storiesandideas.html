                        <h4>Ideas of Tibetan Buddhism</h4>
                        2,500 years ago in Nepal, it is believed by Buddhists that Siddhartha Gautama became enlightened
                        - a term referring to a perfect understanding of the world and reality - and became the Buddha,
                        meaning “the awakened one”. Through his teachings, Buddhism was formed. Buddhists believe in
                        samsara, a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is filled with dukkha, the temporality of
                        life. Only through enlightenment can samsara be escaped and Nirvana, the ending of samsara and
                        all suffering, be reached. It is important to note that in samsara, it is not souls that undergo
                        rebirth but karmic conditions, habitual tendencies that are conditioned by karma, another
                        fundamental belief of Buddhism.<br><br>
                        Karma simultaneously refers to a person’s actions and those actions consequences and accumulates
                        throughout a person’s life, carrying on with them to the next cycle. In his book “Kindness,
                        Clarity, and Insight” the Dalai Lama speaks of the consequences of karma, saying “Countless
                        rebirths lie ahead, both good and bad. The effects of karma (actions) are inevitable, and in
                        previous lifetimes we have accumulated negative karma which will inevitably have its fruition in
                        this or future lives.... [we] must face the consequences of faulty actions we have committed in
                        the past… we must eventually undergo their effects.” Just like with negative karma, there is
                        also positive karma, with good actions bearing good fruit.<br><br>
                        In Buddha’s teachings, one of the fundamental concepts is the Four Noble Truths which explain
                        the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and finally, the path that
                        leads to the end of suffering. By following the path that leads to the end of suffering, called
                        the Eightfold Path, Nirvana may one day be reached.<br><br>
                        <h5>Manifestation of Tibetan Buddhist Ideas on the Dalai Lama’s Twitter</h5>
                        The Dalai Lama, while not posting any written content of the Buddha, created three live webcasts
                        talking about teachings of the life stories of the Buddha that he linked to in tweets, the most
                        recent of which was posted in 2014. Similarly, he posted four live webcasts the first being
                        posted in 2011 and the last in 2013, about stages and paths of enlightenment while not having
                        addressed enlightenment in any of his written tweets. Links to these webcasts, which aired live
                        at the time, have expired. Follower engagement of these posts was lower than his normal average,
                        though this is likely due to these webcasts being posted in the earlier stages of his account,
                        with the Dalai Lama having joined in 2009.<br><br>
                        While samsara or rebirth is never mentioned in the Dalai Lama’s tweets, he has posted about
                        karma in 2017, writing in a tweet that “Karma means action and action motivated by compassion is
                        good. To complain that what happens to you is just the result of your karma is lazy. Instead,
                        confidently recalling the advice that, ‘You are your own master,’ you can change what happens by
                        taking action.” This tweet had reasonable follower engagement, being retweeted over 31 thousand
                        times and favorited over 78 thousand times. This tweet contains not only the concept of karma
                        but also the importance of compassion, a fundamental value of Buddhism. Tweets that are related
                        to the consequences of negative actions show up 28 times, with an average of 10996 favorites and
                        7066 retweets; tweets about positivity show up 54 times with a similar retweet average but over
                        double the favorites at 21227.<br><br>
                        Dukkha is also never tweeted about, nor a direct mention of the four noble truths but suffering
                        is mentioned in 24 tweets by the Dalai Lama, with most tweets being related to either the
                        avoidance of suffering or alleviating the suffering of others. On average, these tweets were
                        retweeted 11355 times and favorited 26710 times.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Ideas of Catholicism</h4>
                        Catholicism, as we know it today, has a deep history, and is believed to have been started in
                        circa AD 30-95. It is believed that Saint Paul was the first known bishop to reside, and
                        eventually die, in Rome. It is also believed that Peter, a fellow disciple of Jesus who is
                        believed by Catholics to be the son of God, was martyred in Rome. With the resting place of two
                        prominent religious figures located in the same country, Rome became the center of Catholicism
                        and it remains so to this day.<br><br>
                        The core tenets of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed which is a declaration of the
                        Catholic faith. A few main themes of this creed are the belief that God created heaven and earth
                        and sent his only son, Jesus, to earth to bring salvation to mankind. It mentions that Jesus
                        died for man’s sins so that man’s sins can be forgiven and that he rose on the third day and
                        ascended into heaven and is now seated at the right hand of God.<br>
                        In Catholicism, sins refer to actions that go against the ten commandments. These commandments
                        were given to Moses -a key religious figure prominent in the old testament of the bible - by God
                        and are as follows: There will be no god other than the one true God, Thou shall not take God’s
                        name in vain, Honor Sunday as a day of rest, Honor thy mother and father, Thou shall not kill,
                        thou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not steal, thou shall not lie, thou shall not covet
                        thy neighbor's wife, and thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods (“Catholicism”).<br><br>
                        Followers of Catholicism abide by these ten commandments so that they may eventually enter
                        heaven. Catholics believe in three states of being after death. The first, Heaven, is defined as
                        a “place of perfect peace and joy”(“Afterlife and Salvation”). The second state of being to
                        reside in is purgatory, and it is believed by Catholics that those who have committed sins but
                        are still redeemable enter purgatory, where they stay and receive punishment until their souls
                        are cleansed of sin at which point they enter heaven. The last state of being to reside in is
                        hell, where those who are too corrupted by sin go. Hell was once defined as being a place of
                        unending torment. Today, however, hell is defined as a place without god’s presence, where its
                        denizens spend eternity in “endless sorrow away from all good and truth” (“Afterlife and
                        Salvation”).<br><br>
                        <h5>Manifestation of Catholic Ideas on the Pope’s Twitter</h5>
                        It should come as no surprise that God, the most important figure in Catholicism, is talked
                        about by the pope in 614 of his tweets, and Jesus Christ 339 times. With such a large amount of
                        tweets, the spread of topics that they feature in is diverse, but most preach the importance of
                        having faith in and accepting them as well as their love for us.<br><br>
                        The commandments are mentioned three times by the pope in his tweets, the most recent of which
                        in 2017 had almost 7 thousand retweets and 33 thousand favorites. On the other hand, sin, the
                        consequence of breaking commandments, has been tweeted about 13 times with an average retweet
                        count of 9831 and a favorite count of 27420. Most tweets about sin are related to being saved
                        from it by the mercy of God or Jesus Christ, an example of one tweet being “Where there is sin
                        there is also the merciful Lord God who forgives if you go to Him.”<br><br>
                        Heaven is mentioned many times by the pope in his tweets, at 46 times to date, which is fitting
                        as it can be seen as the end goal of Catholicism, and has similar retweet and favorite average
                        to the pope’s tweets about sin. It is interesting to note that hell and purgatory are never
                        mentioned by the pope in his tweets. One can assume that this is because he wants his followers
                        to keep a positive outlook on Catholic and not come across as judgemental or extreme. Followers
                        of Catholicism believe they can only fo to heaven because Jesus sacrificed himself for us,
                        saving us from our sins. The close ties between being saved and going to heaven show in that the
                        keyword “saved” is mentioned almost as many times as heaven, 32 times total, with averages of 20
                        thousand favorites and 7 thousand retweets.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>
                        The fundamental ideas of Catholocism appeared in many more of the tweets of the Pope than
                        fundamental Buddhist ideas did in the Dalai Lamas. The most interesting difference between the
                        two is that the key religious figure of Buddhism, the Buddha never even showed up in any of the
                        Dalai Lama’s tweets. In contrast, God and Jesus Christ showed up the most frequently used terms
                        in tweets by the pope. I believe this has to do with God and Jesus Christ being a much more
                        fundamental part of Catholicism than the Buddha is in Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br>
