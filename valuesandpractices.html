                    <h1>Values and Practices</h1><br><br>

                    <h4>Values and Practices of Tibetan Buddhism</h4>
                    There are three main branches of Buddhism beliefs following different practices. These branches are
                    Hinayana or Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. All three of these branch’s practices have the goal
                    of eventually overcoming samsaric activities, Tibetan Buddhism is unique in that it is centered
                    around Vajrayana practices, though Hinayana and Mahayana activities are still observed.<br><br>

                    In Theravada, teachings consist primarily of karma, and meditation is practiced so that distance
                    from thoughts and feelings that are difficult can be created. It is believed that by following these
                    practices, the practitioner may understand that their thoughts and feelings are not personal, thus
                    allowing them to act in ways in which they will gain positive karma. In Hinayana, the focus is on
                    the self and it is individual attainment of enlightenment that is pursued by the practitioner.
                    Mahayana includes Theravada teachings but also involves compassion for others. Mahayana teaches that
                    the world can be changed by our thoughts, words, and actions. By following Mahayana teachings, the
                    practitioner gains a greater sense of compassion and wisdom. In practicing Mahayana, the
                    practitioner is not only trying to obtain enlightenment but also trying to help others that are
                    trapped in samsara, so that everyone may reach Nirvana.<br><br>

                    The last branch is Vajrayana, in which Tibetan Buddhism is built around. In Vajrayana, the teachings
                    are centered on the mind, and the practitioner attempts to overcome their fixations on their ego,
                    attachments, and indifference. Vajrayana is considered to be a much quicker path to attain
                    enlightenment in that unlike Theraveda and Mahayana, techniques are provided. In Vajrayana, the
                    practitioner imagines themselves as having already achieved enlightenment and uses this perception
                    in order to more quickly attain enlightenment. It is believed that the Buddha himself is but a
                    “mirror to our own mind” (“Buddha’s Teachings”). Common Vajrayana practices include meditation,
                    reflection, various rituals, good ethics, and the mind and body.<br><br>

                    All branches of Buddhism also follow five moral precepts, which prohibit taking a life, taking what
                    is not given, sexual misconduct, wrong speech such as lying or gossiping and using intoxicants such
                    as drugs or alcohol that clouds the mind.<br><br>

                    <br>

                    While none of the branches of Buddhism are mentioned in the Dalai Lama’s tweets, a major theme in
                    many of the tweets by the Dalai Lama is compassion, a major teaching of Theravada; it shows up in
                    307 of his tweets and these tweets have an average retweet count of 10 thousand and favorite count
                    of 20 thousand. Practices of Buddhism are mentioned to a much lesser amount; meditation shows up in
                    four tweets, reflection in ten. Caring for the mind and body is tweeted about much more often, at
                    200 times total. 

                    Following the morals of Buddhism and being ethical are mentioned in 37 tweets by the Dalai Lama,
                    though the five moral precepts are not mentioned specifically.<br><br><br>
                    <h4>Values and Practices of Catholicism</h4>
                    While there are countless practices in Catholicism, there are a few that can be considered main
                    practices. A series of practices or sacraments or taken throughout a Catholic's life, the first of
                    which is Baptism, where a priest who presides over this ritual anoints the person being baptized
                    with oils, after which holy water is poured over their head. It is believed by Catholics that during
                    this process, a person is cleansed of sin. The second sacrament a Catholic undergoes is their first
                    Holy Communion. Communion is a central part of catholicism and takes place at every mass, in which
                    Catholics partake in wine and bread believed to represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ. By
                    taking part in communion Catholics believe they become a part of Jesus and express their union with
                    the catholic church. Confirmation is another important Catholic sacrament, in which a person is
                    accepted as a full-fledged member of the catholic church. The sacrament of Penance takes place
                    periodically throughout a Catholics lifetime. This sacrament has three main parts, the first of
                    which, confession is where sins are confessed to a priest. The second is contrition where you are
                    sorry for your sins, and the third, penance, is where the priest gives you a penance to perform
                    after confessing your sins, after which the priest grants absolution of the catholic sin. Marriage
                    is another Catholic sacrament, in which a couple vows the permanence of their marriage and that they
                    will be faithful and open to children. The last sacrament of a Catholics life is the anointing of
                    the sick. During this ritual, the priest anoints the catholic with holy oil and absolves them of the
                    sins they feel remorse for but have not confessed to. This place can take many times as people can
                    recover from illness.<br><br>
                    Outside of the sacraments, Catholics also take part in several holidays throughout the year. Some
                    main ones are Christmas, Lent, and Easter. All of these holidays correspond with an important part
                    of Jesus’s life. The first one, Christmas is when Jesus was born. Lent takes place forty days before
                    Easter, and it is during this time that Catholics fast in penance and reflection. Easter celebrates
                    Jesus’s resurrection and gives Catholics hope that they will experience resurrected life in Heaven.
                    Prayer is also a key part of a Catholics life and falls into four types. The first, adoration are
                    prayers praising God, the second, contrition, are prayers asking for forgiveness, Petition is the
                    third, and are when the prayers are asking for a favor. Finally, the fourth is thanksgiving, prayers
                    that show gratitude to God.<br><br>

                    Some of the most important values that Catholics try to uphold are the concepts of mercy,
                    forgiveness, and care for others. Believing that everything is created by God, they show their faith
                    by “protect[ing] people and the planet, living [their] faith in relationship with all of God’s
                    creation.” (“Afterlife and Salvation”)<br><br>
                    <h5>Appearance of Values and Practices on the Pope’s Twitter</h5><br>
                    <img src="pontifex.png" alt="word map" class="center"><center><i>Word Cloud of the most frequent terms appearing in Pope Francis's Tweets</i></center><br><br>
                    The term sacraments are mentioned 16 times by the pope in his tweets and are mostly about
                    celebrating the power and importance of the sacraments, “In the Sacraments we the strength to think
                    and to act according to the Gospel.” Specific sacraments are also frequently mentioned; there are 15
                    tweets about baptism, 21 about communion, 3 about confirmation, 16 about confession, 1 about
                    penance, 8 about marriage.<br><br>
                    Of the holidays previously discussed, the pope has frequently tweeted about them. Christmas is
                    mentioned 19 times, lent 59 times, and easter 17. Fittingly, all mentions of these holidays take
                    place around their respective dates. Interestingly, in spite of lent being mentioned the most often
                    it has the least number of average retweets and favorites at around 7 thousand and 24 thousand
                    respectively, with Christmas being just ahead of it. Tweets about easter are much farther ahead in
                    average retweet counts - 12 thousand, and favorite counts - 47 thousand.<br><br>

                    Prayer is mentioned by the pope an exorbitant amount of times, 297, emphasizing it’s importance as a
                    Catholic practice. Values of mercy, forgiveness, and care are also frequently mentioned, at 135
                    times, 81 times, and 65 times.<br><br><br>
                    <h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>
                    Both the pope and the Dalai Lama posted tweets about the major values and practices of their
                    respective religions. Since ethics and morals are part of the Catholic faith also, though not
                    mentioned nearly as often as Buddhism, I decided to see how many times they were mentioned by the
                    pope, finding that they were only mentioned six times. This helps solidify the emphasis that
                    Buddhism as a religion places on these values.
