                    <h1>Stereotypes and Norms</h1>


                    <p><br><br>

                        <h4>Stereotypes of Tibetan Buddhism</h4>
                        Of the stereotypes of Tibetan Buddhism that are frequently seen, the belief that all followers
                        meditate, are vegetarian, and are not materialistic are the most common.<br><br>
                        <h5>Are Tibetan Buddhist Stereotypes Shown as Norms by the Dalai Lama?</h5>
                        As meditation is only mentioned four times by the Dalai Lama, and vegetarian zero times, I would
                        not say that these are considered as norms by the Dalai Lama for Tibetan Buddhism. On the other
                        hand, disparagement of materialism as a source of happiness or well-being is a common theme,
                        showing up in 34 tweets. However, the stereotype of Tibetan Buddhists shunning materialism is
                        not the complete story of this norm, the Dalai Lama commonly writes that it materialism is not
                        the problem, but the belief that it is the solution to our problems, in one post he writes “I
                        try to share with other people that the ultimate source of happiness is within us; it’s not
                        found in money and fame.”<br><br><br>
                        <h4> Stereotypes of Catholicism</h4>
                        Some common stereotypes of Catholicism are that Catholics must obey the pope, being judgemental
                        of LGBT peoples, and rejection of science.<br><br>
                        <h5>Are Catholic Stereotypes Shown as Norms by the Pope?</h5>
                        No tweets by the pope show an expectance to be obeyed, and so it can be said that this is not a
                        norm that appears on his Twitter. There are also no tweets concerning LGBT people posted by the
                        pope on his twitter. For science, the pope expressed his support of it on World Science Day; he
                        also posted another tweet saying that “Science expresses its full dignity when it serves the
                        integral development of the person and the human family,” so he may be more supportive when it
                        serves causes he believes in.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>
                        With the exception of disagreeing with materialism serving a great purpose by the Dalai Lama,
                        both the pope and the Dalai Lama did not show that the common stereotypes about their religion
                        are norms that they support, though they also did not make any tweets outright disagreeing with
                        them. In the case of science, I find it interesting that while the pope only tweeted about it a
                        few times, the Dalai Lama iterated its importance in ten tweets, showing that support of science
                        is much more a norm in Buddhism than in Catholicism.<br><br>
